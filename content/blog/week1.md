# Starting My Independent Journey

This week I began planning my WeChat Mini Program for the Chinese community in UAE. The initial research showed there's a significant gap in the market for localized services.

## Key learnings:

* Vue.js with TDesign provides excellent UI components specifically optimized for WeChat ecosystem
* WeChat developer tools have improved significantly, but still present challenges for complex applications
* The biggest challenge will be optimizing for both Chinese and UAE network conditions

I've started by building a simple prototype that focuses on the core user journey. The initial feedback from potential users has been encouraging, with many expressing interest in features like:

1. Arabic-Chinese translation for common phrases
2. Location-based service recommendations
3. Community event listings

Next week, I plan to implement the authentication flow and test the core navigation structure.
